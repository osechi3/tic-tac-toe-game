This project was made as a part of The Odin Project Curriculum. It's a Tic Tac Toe game playable from a web browser. 

2 players enter their names (optionally) then they take turns marking a grid with O and X letters. Once a player gets 3-in-a-row the game shows a box congratulating the winner and asking whether players would like to play again. If nobody gets 3-in-a-row after all grid cells get taken up the game shows a box calling it a tie.
